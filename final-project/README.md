# Final Project

## Description

This is a web application intended to manage CRUD operations across three modules: Stock, Shopping, and Products. PHP and SQL are the primary technologies for server-side processing and data management, while JavaScript is used to enhance the GUI with interactive elements. jQuery simplifies client-side scripting, and AJAX is crucial for enabling asynchronous web functionality, ensuring uninterrupted user interaction with the application.

> [!NOTE]
> Each CRUD view is dynamically generated by the Controller class. This provides a consistent interface and **reduces the amount of repetitive code**. For a deeper understanding of how this works, see: [controller.php](controllers/controller.php).

## Setup

1. Update the [config.php](config/config.php) file according to your requirements.

2. Create a database named after the $db_name variable in the [db.php](config/config.php) file. By default, it is named `eam_20232final`.

    ```bash
    mysql -u <user> -p -e "CREATE DATABASE eam_20232final"
    ```

3. Import the [db_final.sql](db_final.sql) database file.

    ```bash
    mysql -u <user> -p eam_20232final < db_final.sql
    ```

## Run

To run the application, execute the following command from the root of the project.

```bash
php -S localhost:8000
```

Then, open your web browser and navigate to the following URL: http://localhost:8000
